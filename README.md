# 🚀 Revolutionizing Java Concurrency with Virtual Threads (Project Loom)

Welcome to the official GitHub documentation for the research project **"Revolutionizing Java Concurrency"**, focused on benchmarking and implementing **Virtual Threads** in Java 21+.

## 📚 Overview

This repository includes benchmark insights, code examples, performance analysis, and compatibility strategies for **Virtual Threads** introduced under **Project Loom**.

The objective is to demonstrate the **scalability**, **memory efficiency**, and **developer simplicity** virtual threads offer compared to traditional platform threads — particularly in **I/O-bound**, **CPU-bound**, and **mixed workload systems**.

## 💡 Code & Implementation-Based Questions (Based on the Research Study)

### 1. What is the syntax for creating a virtual thread in Java?

Java 21+ supports creating virtual threads using the new `Thread.ofVirtual()` or the `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` syntax.

#### Example 1: Using `Thread.ofVirtual()`
```java
Thread vThread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread!");
});
```

#### Example 2: Using ExecutorService
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread.");
});
```
This approach enables creating thousands of concurrent threads with minimal memory usage.  
📖 *Reference: Section 2.2, 4.4*

### 2. What is an example of structured concurrency in Java?

Structured concurrency allows multiple concurrent tasks to be **scoped, managed, and cancelled** as a single logical unit.

#### ✅ Example:
```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> user = scope.fork(() -> fetchUserDetails());
    Future<String> order = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrderDetails());

    scope.join();  // Wait for both tasks to complete

    System.out.println(user.resultNow() + ", " + order.resultNow());
}
```

### 3. Which legacy code constructs are compatible with virtual threads?

#### ✅ Compatible Constructs:
- `Runnable`, `Callable`, `ExecutorService`
- Blocking I/O APIs: `InputStream`, `Socket`, etc.
- Traditional synchronous Java code

#### Example:
```java
Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    try {
        InputStream in = socket.getInputStream();
        in.read();  // Blocking I/O — works seamlessly with virtual threads
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});
```

### 4. What are the ways to avoid thread pinning in virtual threads?

#### Strategies:
| ❌ Avoid This                             | ✅ Use This Instead                         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Wide `synchronized` blocks               | `ReentrantLock`                             |
| `Object.wait()`                          | Structured concurrency                      |
| Legacy JDBC                              | R2DBC or non-blocking libraries             |
| JNI/native calls                         | Loom-aware replacements                     |

#### Tools:
- `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=true`
- Java Flight Recorder (JFR)
- VisualVM / `jstack`

### 5. Where were virtual threads implemented in your project?

#### Examples:
- I/O-bound: Student portals, IRCTC simulation
- Mixed workloads: Seat booking, OTP, fare
- Chat system: 50K concurrent virtual threads
- Student ERP: 10K login simulations

📖 *Reference: Section 4.1, 4.3, 4.7*

---

### 6. What are the implications of virtual threads on the JVM and the application?

#### JVM Impact:
- Threads managed by JVM (not OS)
- Reduced memory per thread (~4KB–8KB)
- Better context switching
- Increased GC pressure due to heap-based stacks

#### Application Impact:
- Easier scaling (100K+ threads)
- Simpler code (no async boilerplate)
- New thinking: use `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` instead of fixed thread pools
