## 📚 Project Summary

This project explores the performance and practical application of **Virtual Threads** introduced by **Project Loom** in Java 21. It includes a comparative analysis between traditional platform threads and virtual threads using various workloads like:

- I/O-bound tasks (e.g., result portals, network-based apps)
- CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computational simulations)
- Mixed workloads (e.g., IRCTC-style ticket booking)

Key focus areas:
- **Benchmarking throughput, memory usage, and latency**
- **Thread pinning and how to avoid it**
- **Structured concurrency with `StructuredTaskScope`**
- **Real-world simulation: Chat system, ERP login flood, ticket booking**

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Java 21 (Project Loom Preview)**
- **VisualVM**, **JMeter**, **JFR**, **htop**
- **StructuredTaskScope API**
- **Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()**
- **ReentrantLock**, **R2DBC**, and Loom-compatible constructs

---

## 📝 Research Highlights

- Achieved **11x higher throughput** in I/O-heavy use cases using virtual threads.
- Demonstrated **~80% memory savings** in large-scale simulations.
- Simulated **50,000+ concurrent users** in chat and ERP testbeds.
- Identified thread pinning pitfalls and Loom optimization strategies.
