### ‚úÖ Key Observations

* üî• **Virtual threads** consistently outperform platform threads in **throughput** (up to 60√ó faster).
* üíæ **Memory usage** is significantly lower in virtual threads at higher loads.
* ‚è±Ô∏è Virtual threads maintain **predictable performance** even at 20,000 tasks.
