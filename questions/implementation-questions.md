## üí° Code & Implementation-Based Questions (Based on the Research Study)
---
### 1. What is the syntax for creating a virtual thread in Java?

Java 21+ supports creating virtual threads using the new `Thread.ofVirtual()` or the `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` syntax.

#### Example 1: Using `Thread.ofVirtual()`
```java
Thread vThread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread!");
});
```

#### Example 2: Using ExecutorService
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread.");
});
```
This approach enables creating thousands of concurrent threads with minimal memory usage.

### 2. What is an example of structured concurrency in Java?

Structured concurrency allows multiple concurrent tasks to be **scoped, managed, and cancelled** as a single logical unit. This prevents resource leaks, improves exception handling, and ensures predictable task behavior.

In **Java 21**, the `StructuredTaskScope` API enables structured concurrency.

#### ‚úÖ Example:
```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> user = scope.fork(() -> fetchUserDetails());
    Future<String> order = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrderDetails());

    scope.join();  // Wait for both tasks to complete

    System.out.println(user.resultNow() + ", " + order.resultNow());
}
```
This example demonstrates how to use `StructuredTaskScope` to manage two concurrent tasks, ensuring they are resourced properly when cancelled or completed.

### 3. Which legacy code constructs are compatible with virtual threads?

Virtual threads in Java (introduced via Project Loom) are designed to be **fully compatible** with most existing Java code. This makes migration from platform threads smoother and allows the use of familiar APIs.

#### ‚úÖ Compatible Constructs:
- **Traditional Thread API**: `Runnable`, `Callable`, `ExecutorService`
- **Blocking I/O APIs**: e.g., `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Socket`, `BufferedReader`
- **Synchronous (blocking-style) Java code**: Works seamlessly without requiring reactive or asynchronous rewrites

#### üîÅ Example ‚Äì Using `InputStream` with a virtual thread:
```java
Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    try {
        InputStream in = socket.getInputStream();
        in.read();  // Blocking I/O ‚Äî works seamlessly with virtual threads
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
});
```
This example shows how to use a virtual thread to perform blocking I/O operations, which are fully compatible with the traditional Java threading model.

### 4. What are the ways to avoid thread pinning in virtual threads?

To fully utilize the scalability benefits of **virtual threads**, it is important to **avoid thread pinning** ‚Äî a condition where a virtual thread becomes **stuck (pinned)** to a carrier platform thread, losing its lightweight nature.

#### üß† What Causes Pinning?
Pinning typically occurs when legacy or blocking constructs are used that prevent the JVM from unmounting the virtual thread from its carrier thread.

#### ‚úÖ Strategies to Avoid Pinning:

| ‚ùå Avoid This                             | ‚úÖ Use This Instead                         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Wide `synchronized` blocks               | `ReentrantLock` or fine-grained locking     |
| `Object.wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`| Structured concurrency or scoped channels   |
| Legacy JDBC drivers (blocking DB I/O)    | **R2DBC** or other non-blocking DB clients  |
| Native methods or JNI code               | Loom-aware or async-native alternatives     |
| Blocking on old I/O APIs                 | `java.nio`, asynchronous or Loom-compatible I/O |

#### üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Tools:
- `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=true` ‚Üí JVM flag to log when pinning happens
- **Java Flight Recorder (JFR)** ‚Üí Analyze pinning events in production
- **VisualVM / jstack** ‚Üí Monitor thread behavior and locking hotspots

These precautions help ensure virtual threads remain **lightweight**, highly **scalable**, and **non-blocking**, particularly under high-concurrency workloads.

### 5. Where were virtual threads implemented in your project?

In this research project, **virtual threads** were implemented and tested across multiple real-world inspired benchmarking scenarios to assess their scalability and efficiency.

#### üß™ Implementation Scenarios:

1. **I/O-Bound Workloads**  
   - Simulated student **result portals**, **chatbot services**, and **IRCTC-like booking systems** where threads wait on network/database.
   - Virtual threads efficiently handled thousands of concurrent I/O-bound tasks.

2. **Mixed Workloads**  
   - IRCTC-style **ticket booking flow**, including:
     - Seat availability checks (I/O)
     - Fare calculations (CPU)
     - OTP/SMS verification (I/O)
   - Virtual threads allowed smooth execution without memory exhaustion.

3. **Chat System Simulation**  
   - **50,000 concurrent virtual threads** simulated user messaging.
   - Result: ~80% lower memory usage compared to platform threads.

4. **Student ERP Portal**  
   - Simulated **10,000+ login sessions** during result declaration.
   - Virtual threads kept response time stable and prevented crashes.

#### üß† Key Benefits Observed:
- Low memory footprint (~4KB/thread)
- High throughput on I/O tasks
- Simplified implementation with blocking-style code

### 6. What are the implications of virtual threads on the JVM and the application?

The introduction of **virtual threads** via Project Loom has significant implications on both the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and application design.

#### üîß Implications on the JVM:

- **Thread Management Shift**:  
  Virtual threads are managed by the JVM itself rather than the OS kernel. This reduces overhead related to native thread creation and destruction.

- **Reduced Memory Usage**:  
  - Platform threads consume ~1MB stack memory per thread.
  - Virtual threads consume only ~4KB‚Äì8KB.
  - Result: JVM can support **millions** of threads concurrently without OutOfMemoryErrors.

- **Garbage Collection Behavior**:  
  As virtual thread stacks reside in the heap, **heap churn** may increase, potentially adding **GC pressure** in high-scale systems.

- **Context Switching Efficiency**:  
  Lightweight, cooperative scheduling managed inside the JVM leads to **low-latency context switches**, improving throughput and responsiveness.

#### üèóÔ∏è Implications on Applications:

- **Scalability**:  
  Applications can now scale to **hundreds of thousands of concurrent operations**, especially for I/O-heavy use cases.

- **Simplified Codebase**:  
  Developers can write **blocking-style code** (e.g., `InputStream.read()`, `sleep()`) that looks synchronous but scales like asynchronous code.

- **Improved Developer Productivity**:  
  No need for complex patterns like `CompletableFuture`, reactive streams, or callback hell.

- **Thread Pool Rethinking**:  
  Traditional `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` might be replaced with:
  ```java
  Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
  ```
