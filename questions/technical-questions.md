## üîç Technical & Benchmark-Oriented Questions (Based on Research Study)

### 1. What type of workloads were used in the benchmark tests?
The benchmark tests in this study evaluated three real-world workload categories:

- **I/O-bound tasks**: Simulated using `Thread.sleep()` to model network and DB latency.
- **CPU-bound tasks**: Prime number validation algorithm to represent heavy computation.
- **Mixed workloads**: Combined I/O delays and CPU operations (e.g., IRCTC-style booking logic).

These were chosen to reflect practical scenarios found in academic portals, railway systems, and enterprise platforms.  
(*Ref: Section 3.2, 4.1*)

### 2. What was your test environment setup?
The experiments were executed on a controlled environment with the following configuration:

- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS (Kernel 5.15)
- **Processor**: Intel Core i7 (Quad-core, 8 threads, 2.80 GHz)
- **RAM**: 32 GB DDR4
- **Disk**: 512 GB NVMe SSD
- **JDK**: OpenJDK 21 (with preview features for Virtual Threads / Loom)
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter 5.5, VisualVM, `jstack`, `htop`  
(*Ref: Section 3.1*)

---

### 3. How was performance measured during the benchmarking?
Performance was measured using the following metrics:

- **Throughput** (requests or task completions per second)
- **Latency** (average, P95, and P99 response times)
- **Memory usage** (heap + per-thread stack via MemoryMXBean)
- **CPU usage** (via VisualVM and `htop`)
- **Thread creation overhead** (measured spawn time for 10K‚Äì100K threads)

Tools like Apache JMeter and VisualVM were used to simulate load and capture metrics.  
(*Ref: Section 3.3, 4.1‚Äì4.3*)

### 4. What is thread pinning, and how did you handle it?
**Thread pinning** occurs when a virtual thread is "stuck" to its underlying carrier thread (e.g., due to native calls or synchronization), reducing concurrency benefits.

This was mitigated by:
- Avoiding wide `synchronized` blocks
- Using `ReentrantLock` instead of intrinsic locks
- Replacing legacy I/O with Loom-compatible APIs (e.g., R2DBC)
- Using `-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads` and Java Flight Recorder to detect pinning

(*Ref: Section 4.6*)

### 5. How did platform threads and virtual threads compare in terms of throughput?
Throughput results:

- **I/O-bound tasks**:
  - Platform Threads: ~2,000 req/s
  - Virtual Threads: ~22,000 req/s
- **CPU-bound tasks**:
  - Both thread types showed similar performance (~200 tasks/sec)

Virtual threads provided **up to 11x higher throughput** in I/O scenarios.  
(*Ref: Section 4.1.1, Table ‚Äì Comparative Thread Performance*)

---

### 6. What was the memory usage of platform threads versus virtual threads?
Empirical memory profiling showed:

- **Platform Threads**: ~1 MB per thread ‚áí ~1,000 threads per GB
- **Virtual Threads**: ~4 KB per thread ‚áí ~250,000 threads per GB

This makes virtual threads significantly more memory-efficient.  
(*Ref: Section 4.2 ‚Äì Table: Measured Memory Footprint Comparison*)

---

### 7. Which thread type performed better in scalability tests?
In stress tests:

- **Platform threads** struggled beyond ~10,000 threads (due to memory and context switching).
- **Virtual threads** scaled efficiently to **100,000+ concurrent threads** without system failure.

Hence, virtual threads demonstrated far better scalability.  
(*Ref: Section 4.3*)

---

### 8. Which tools did you use for monitoring during benchmarks?
Monitoring and profiling tools included:

- **Apache JMeter** ‚Äì Load simulation and request measurement
- **VisualVM** ‚Äì JVM metrics (heap, threads, CPU)
- **`jstack`** ‚Äì Thread dumps
- **`htop`** ‚Äì OS-level CPU and memory usage
- **MemoryMXBean** ‚Äì Heap analysis via Java Management API  
(*Ref: Section 3.3, 4.2*)

---

### 9. What role did JVM warm-up and JIT optimizations play in testing?
To ensure accuracy:

- **JVM warm-up** was performed before measurements (discarded cold start results).
- **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation effects were stabilized before recording.
- Each test was repeated 3 times and averaged.

This reduced variability and captured realistic, optimized runtime behavior.  
(*Ref: Section 3.3.E, 3.4.B*)

---

### 10. How did you validate your benchmark results?
Benchmark validation approach:

- **Three trial runs** per test; average result considered
- **Post-warm-up measurement only**
- **Results verified using multiple tools**
- **All code, configs, and workloads** are publicly available in GitHub:
  - [Benchmark Code ‚Äì GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adityadevraj699/revolutionizing-java-concurrency)

This ensures reproducibility and transparent validation.  
(*Ref: Section 3.5*)

---
### 11. What was the primary goal of your benchmarking effort?
The primary goal was to compare the performance of **Java 19's Virtual Threads** against **Platform Threads** in a real-world, concurrent programming scenario. The focus was on demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of virtual threads in a multi-threaded application.
(*Ref: Section 1.1*)
