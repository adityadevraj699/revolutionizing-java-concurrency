## ðŸ§  Summary Insights

- **Virtual Threads consistently outperform Platform Threads** in terms of throughput across all request levels.
- **Latency remains stable** and comparable between the two, with slight advantage to virtual threads in higher load scenarios.
- **Memory usage** is significantly lower for Virtual Threads, highlighting their scalability.
- **Thread creation time** remains negligible in both, but Virtual Threads handle bulk creation more efficiently.
